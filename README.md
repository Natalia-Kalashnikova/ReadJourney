# Read Journey

## Project Overview

**Read Journey** is an app designed to help you manage your book library, track
your reading progress, and discover recommended books. With both statistical and
diary-like views, it provides a seamless reading experience, supporting you
throughout your reading journey.

## Key Features

- **Home Page**: Upon login, registered users are directed to the "Home" page,
  where you can explore a collection of recommended books. The page includes a
  sorting form to filter books by title or author. You can also add recommended
  books to your personal library.

- **My Library**: The "My Library" page displays all the books you've added. You
  can easily manage your collection and add new titles. Each book in your
  library is clickable and leads to a detailed reading page.

- **Reading Page**: On the reading page, you'll find a page number input to
  track your progress, along with reading statistics to monitor how much you've
  read. The reading page gives you insights into your reading habits and helps
  you stay on track.
